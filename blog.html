        <h1>Week 1 Recap: 5/26–5/30</h1>

        <p>I arrived at Huntsville, Alabama on 5/26, but not even a week later I feel like my brain has grown threefold. In just five days, I moved from Massachusetts to Alabama, completed training, toured the facility, met dozens of new people, created a blog, researched persistent homology, learned the basics of GUDHI, and went to Walmart at least three times (like a true Arkansan).</p>

        <p>For this summer, I'll be working with the Leidos Dynetics AI and Machine Learning Branch on a project exploring persistent homology methods and its applications in aerospace. As such, our mentor Mundy ensured we met a majority of the people in the team through multiple lunches and tours (of people--not of the facilities). Everyone I met was happy to make conversation about their projects and provide support for anything. The vibes were immaculate and the culture of Leidos Dynetics as a whole was welcoming.</p>

        <p>While I believe I don't have the strongest coding background coming into this internship, I'm confident I'll leave with a deep understanding. This in-depth experience of working on a machine learning research project while supported by a strong community will push me to grow as a computer scientist, and I'm glad I have this opportunity to try new things at Leidos Dynetics!</p>

        <h1>Week 2 Recap: 6/2–6/6</h1>

        <p>I spent the majority of this week building foundational knowledge for my project. Like I said before, I don't have the strongest coding background coming into this internship, but I'm getting a lot of support to make sure I'm learning along the way. There were two main exercises I worked on: generating data that changes shape over time and training a classifier to identify circles when given data from persistence barcode plots. For the first of the two, I simulated points transforming from a circle to a square over a number of time steps and plotted the persistence barcode plots at each time step (see image below). For the latter, I wasn't able to completely finish the exercise this week, but I generated the data to train it on. The data consisted of 250 circles and non-circles (500 total), with varying amounts of noise. Some were mostly circular, some had randomized peaks sticking out of them, and some had a few points removed. Next week, I'll work on creating and training the classifier. Ideally by the end of these exercises, I'll be able to take my practice code and apply it to my project where I'll analyze the persistence of data that changes over time and train a classifier to identify patterns within that data.</p>

        <p>Outside of work, Parker, Daniel and I went on quite a few side quests. We were given tasks and special events by Mundy, and as video game completionists, we couldn't possibly turn down the adventure. Our first side quest: Leidos drone testing. We didn't do much ourselves, but we got to take (many) photos with the drones and talk with the people conducting the tests about their backgrounds and experiences at Leidos. A couple days later, we went on our second side quest to tour the Leidos facilities, ranging from the electronics lab to the manufacturing building. Our last quest (and in my opinion, the most daunting) was pickleball. Mundy is a pretty big pickleball fan, and everyone keeps saying Daniel is a great pickleball player, so we had to play pickleball at least once during the internship. Unfortunately, I have a history of acquiring a bloody nose every time I play a sport involving a ball, so I was fully prepared to end the day with a tissue up a nostril. Somehow, though, my nose remained dry the entire time, and my hand-eye coordination might have even improved! Jokes aside, I had a great time and a constant smile throughout the game, so I'm looking forward to future pickleball events.</p>
