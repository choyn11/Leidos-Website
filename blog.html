        <h1>Week 1 Recap: 5/26–5/30</h1>

        <p>I arrived at Huntsville, Alabama on 5/26, but not even a week later I feel like my brain has grown threefold. In just five days, I moved from Massachusetts to Alabama, completed training, toured the facility, met dozens of new people, created a blog, researched persistent homology, learned the basics of GUDHI, and went to Walmart at least three times (like a true Arkansan).</p>

        <p>For this summer, I'll be working with the Leidos Dynetics AI and Machine Learning Branch on a project exploring persistent homology methods and its applications in aerospace. As such, our mentor Mundy ensured we met a majority of the people in the team through multiple lunches and tours (of people--not of the facilities). Everyone I met was happy to make conversation about their projects and provide support for anything. The vibes were immaculate and the culture of Leidos Dynetics as a whole was welcoming.</p>

        <p>While I believe I don't have the strongest coding background coming into this internship, I'm confident I'll leave with a deep understanding. This in-depth experience of working on a machine learning research project while supported by a strong community will push me to grow as a computer scientist, and I'm glad I have this opportunity to try new things at Leidos Dynetics!</p>

        <h1>Week 2 Recap: 6/2–6/6</h1>

        <p>I spent the majority of this week building foundational knowledge for my project. Like I said before, I don't have the strongest coding background coming into this internship, but I'm getting a lot of support to make sure I'm learning along the way. There were two main exercises I worked on: generating data that changes shape over time and training a classifier to identify circles when given data from persistence barcode plots. For the first of the two, I simulated points transforming from a circle to a square over a number of time steps and plotted the persistence barcode plots at each time step (see image below). For the latter, I wasn't able to completely finish the exercise this week, but I generated the data to train it on. The data consisted of 250 circles and non-circles (500 total), with varying amounts of noise. Some were mostly circular, some had randomized peaks sticking out of them, and some had a few points removed. Next week, I'll work on creating and training the classifier. Ideally by the end of these exercises, I'll be able to take my practice code and apply it to my project where I'll analyze the persistence of data that changes over time and train a classifier to identify patterns within that data.</p>

        <p>Outside of work, Parker, Daniel and I went on quite a few side quests. We were given tasks and special events by Mundy, and as video game completionists, we couldn't possibly turn down the adventure. Our first side quest: Leidos drone testing. We didn't do much ourselves, but we got to take (many) photos with the drones and talk with the people conducting the tests about their backgrounds and experiences at Leidos. A couple days later, we went on our second side quest to tour the Leidos facilities, ranging from the electronics lab to the manufacturing building. Our last quest (and in my opinion, the most daunting) was pickleball. Mundy is a pretty big pickleball fan, and everyone keeps saying Daniel is a great pickleball player, so we had to play pickleball at least once during the internship. Unfortunately, I have a history of acquiring a bloody nose every time I play a sport involving a ball, so I was fully prepared to end the day with a tissue up a nostril. Somehow, though, my nose remained dry the entire time, and my hand-eye coordination might have even improved! Jokes aside, I had a great time and a constant smile throughout the game, so I'm looking forward to future pickleball events.</p>

        <h1>Week 3 Recap: 6/9–6/13</h1>

        <p>My progress this week was a little slower than the week before, but in my defense, I think I tackled one of my largest knowledge barriers coming into this project: coding a classifier. For the first couple weeks, I was generating and plotting data while learning persistent homology. The former topic wasn't too far off from my previous experiences--I've used matplotlib and numpy for a few projects in my classes, and these small exercises of generating and plotting data were a great way to strengthen my understanding. The latter topic was newer, but persistent homology itself felt very intuitive, at least at the level that I needed to understand it at. Classifiers, on the other hand, felt foreign. I knew what they did but never had to create one and never learned the foundations of how they work. Fortunately, the internet is a great place, and I was able to create a basic circle/non-circle classifier with PyTorch through the help of many articles. My understanding of classifiers still wasn't at the level I wanted it to be by the end of the mini project, but Mundy's weekly AI/ML "bootcamp" helped me greatly. He covered the history and math of classifiers with Parker, Daniel, and me, and he eventually plans to have us create a classifier (and other AI projects) in Excel to improve our understanding of the math behind AI.</p>

        <p>While I knew I would be trying a lot of new things while working at Leidos, I wasn't expecting the learning to continue outside of the office--quite literally. Mundy invited the three of us to go on a foray to look for chanterelles, a type of edible mushroom, as well as other mushrooms. In the end, we didn't find many chanterelles, but we found and documented dozens of mushrooms on iNaturalist. Mundy also invited us to go to Puzzle Pint, a monthly puzzle event, after talking about our common interest in puzzles and hackathons. This activity was much more familiar to me, but it was a great experience nonetheless! We finished all the puzzles except the final metapuzzle, so we're planning to go back next month with the goal to finish everything.</p>

        <h1>Week 4 Recap: 6/16–6/20</h1>

        <p>The past three weeks have been jam packed with mini projects and activities, but this week was a little more relaxed because of Juneteenth. I spent the first few days familiarizing myself with Pandas and cleaning up the data I plan to use for my project. The end goal is to use persistent homology on the data, vectorize their persistence barcode plots, then train a classifier to identify anomalous data from those vectors. Unfortunately, the data isn't labeled with examples of anomalous and standard data to train the classifier, making this task a little more complicated. Instead of immediately working on the classifier, I've been working on clustering the persistence data into groups so a SME (subject matter expert) can label the data afterwards. While I've finished clustering the data, I plan to spend some time next week confirming that the clusters are correct. It's a little difficult to visualize the 35-dimensional data points, but I'm thinking of overlaying the persistence barcode graphs of a few samples from each cluster and seeing if they're similar within the clusters.</p>

        <p>The last couple of days were spent working on the pipeline for the classifier: formatting the data, processing it (persistent homology), training the classifier, then testing it's accuracy. Considering most of the office was out for Juneteenth on Thursday, it was a rather chill day working on something I'd already experimented a bit with (see Week 3 Recap above), and we eventually left the office a couple hours early to spend time with the other interns at Lowe Mill. It's arguably one of the coolest places I've been to so far in Huntsville featuring art from dozens of artists, and it was great getting to bond with other interns outside of the office.</p>
